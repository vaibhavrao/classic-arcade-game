## Instructions

## Objective of the game

The objective of the game is for the player (who starts at the bottom row) to reach to the river with at least 1 remaining life and score as many points as possible.

## Rules

During this journey, the player may collide into either enemies (bugs) or trophies (gems or other shapes like heart, key or star).

Collision with enemies (bugs) decrements the number of remaining lives for the player by 1 and also reduces the score by 100.

Collision with Trophies either leads to increase in points or life boost (increase in number of remaining lives).

When the game begins, the user has 3 lives remaining and a score of 0 points and 3 trophies (2 gems and 1 life boost) are loaded. If user collides with (and claims) all 3 trophies and has at least 1 life, another set of 3 trophies (2 gems and 1 life boost) are loaded. The location of the trophies is random.

Scoring Points:
Blue Gem - 100 points
Green Gem - 200 points
Orange Gem - 300 points

Collision with any of the other trophies (like Heart, Key or Star) increases the number of lives by 1.
